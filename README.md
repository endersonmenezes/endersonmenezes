### History
You already know my name, my idea has always been to provide digital solutions to people and companies in an easy way. In the mid-2006, I started my studies in Pascal, since then I became passionate about logic and programming, in 2008 I opened my first **NarutoLife.tk** website, providing all the online episodes of an Anime all in **HTML** üòú years later along with [Gustavo Quinalha](https://github.com/gustavoquinalha), i started creating online radios with the **Bestdesigner.com.br**, work that was later dissolved and became a Hosting, my first venture.

I started studying physics in 2014 at the State University of Maring√°, dreaming of being a computational physicist. In the same period I started working with a childhood friend Jean Nogueira and, in 2017, we started the idea of DigitalFriends, to help small businesses and associations to make their first steps on the web. In 2018, together with [Orbital Aceleradora de Startups](https://orbital.ac), I was making a better ecosystem for Maring√° and the Region! ‚ù§Ô∏è

In 2019, I have been working at the Governance, Risk and Compliance department of  [UniCesumar](https://unicesumar.edu.br), seeking to automate internal audit processes and improve data decisions with integrations and analyzes, this job ending on Setember/2020. 

Since the UniCesumar, I worked at [Cortex Intelligence](https://cortex-intelligence.com) with Data Engineer for the most valuable companyes from Brazil, we are using top of technology for data integrations.üìö

Since university I worked at Cortex Intelligence, seeking to develop a scalable architecture with lambdas to capture data from different sources.

Now I'm helping [Stone Payments](http://stone.co/) to grow, being part of the infrastructure team and developing automations that help this team and the entire company.
