### History

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  You already know my name, my idea has always been to provide digital solutions for people and companies in an easy way, even without knowing what that was right. In mid-2006, I started my studies in Pascal with Binary Tree, since then I fell in love with Algorithms and Programming, in 2008 I opened my first site **NarutoLife.tk**, making all episodes of an Anime available online, a site built entirely in **HTML** 游땦. Years later, together with [Gustavo Quinalha](https://github.com/gustavoquinalha), we started to create online radios **Bestdesigner.com.br**, work that became Hosting for Sites and Games, my first venture.

![Years Later](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K5bgq69ujs4/hqdefault.jpg)

I started studying physics in 2014 at the State University of Maring치 (UEM), dreaming of being a computational physicist. In the same period I started working with a childhood friend Jean Nogueira and, in 2017, we started the idea of **DigitalFriends**, to help small businesses and associations take their first steps on the web, we were a kind of digital agency.

In 2018, together with [Orbital Aceleradora de Startups](https://orbital.ac), I was making a better ecosystem for Maring치 and the Region, helping people and companies to create their own startups! 仇벒잺

In 2019, I have been working at the Governance, Risk and Compliance department of [UniCesumar](https://unicesumar.edu.br), seeking to automate internal audit processes and improve data decisions with integrations and analyzes, this job ending on September/2020.

Since the last job, I worked at [Cortex Intelligence](https://cortex-intelligence.com) with Data Engineer for the most valuable companies from Brazil, we are using top of technology for data integrations.游닄

In 2021/2022 I helped [Stone Payments](http://stone.co/) to grow, being part of the infrastructure team and developing automation's that help this team and the entire company.

Now, I'm working at [Toku](https://trytoku.com) and helping the company to automate recurring payments throughout Latin America.
