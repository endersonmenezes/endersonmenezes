### History

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
You already know my name, my idea has always been to provide digital solutions for people and companies in an easy way, even without knowing what that was right. In mid-2006, I started my studies in Pascal with Binary Tree, since then I fell in love with Algorithms and Programming, in 2008 I opened my first site **NarutoLife.tk**, making all episodes of an Anime available online, a site built entirely in **HTML** üòú. Years later, together with [Gustavo Quinalha](https://github.com/gustavoquinalha), we started to create online radios **Bestdesigner.com.br**, work that became Hosting for Sites and Games, my first venture.

I began my journey studying physics in 2014 at the State University of Maring√° (UEM), with dreams of becoming a computational physicist. During this time, I also started working with a childhood friend, Jean Nogueira. In 2017, we launched **DigitalFriends**, a digital agency aimed at helping small businesses and associations establish their online presence.

In 2018, in collaboration with [Orbital Aceleradora de Startups](https://orbital.ac), I contributed to creating a better ecosystem for startups in Maring√° and the surrounding region. It was a fulfilling experience to help individuals and companies bring their startup ideas to life.

In 2019, I joined the Governance, Risk, and Compliance department at [UniCesumar](https://unicesumar.edu.br). My role involved automating internal audit processes and improving data-driven decisions through integrations and analyses. I continued in this role until September 2020.

Following my stint at UniCesumar, I worked at [Cortex Intelligence](https://cortex-intelligence.com) as a Data Engineer. Here, I had the opportunity to work with some of Brazil‚Äôs most valuable companies, using cutting-edge technology for data integrations.

In 2021/2022, I played a significant role in helping [Stone Payments](http://stone.co/) grow. As part of the infrastructure team, I developed automations that not only benefited our team but the entire company.

In 2021/2022 I helped [Stone Payments](http://stone.co/) to grow, being part of the infrastructure team and developing automation's that help this team and the entire company.

After my time at Stone Payments, I joined [Toku](https://trytoku.com), where I helped automate recurring payments across Latin America, primarily working on an internal platform.

Now, I have returned to Stone Payments with a renewed focus and dream of transforming the entire development experience. I am excited to continue making a difference and help the company reach new heights.
