I really love Python and Linux, support communities and play online games!

### History

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
My goal has always been to provide accessible digital solutions for people and companies, even before I fully understood what that entailed.

My journey into technology began in mid-2006 with studies in Pascal and data structures like Binary Trees. I immediately fell in love with algorithms and programming. In 2008, I launched my first site, **NarutoLife.tk**, making anime episodes available online—a project built entirely in **HTML**.

Years later, alongside [Gustavo Quinalha](https://github.com/gustavoquinalha), I co-founded **Bestdesigner.com.br** to create online radios. This project eventually evolved into my first venture: a hosting service for websites and games.

In 2014, I pursued a degree in Physics at the State University of Maringá (UEM), aspiring to become a computational physicist. During this time, I also partnered with my childhood friend, Jean Nogueira. In 2017, we launched **DigitalFriends**, a digital agency focused on helping small businesses and associations establish their online presence.

In 2018, in collaboration with [Orbital Aceleradora de Startups](https://orbital.ac), I contributed to building a stronger ecosystem for startups in Maringá and the surrounding region. It was a fulfilling experience helping individuals and companies bring their ideas to life.

In 2019, I joined the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) department at [UniCesumar](https://unicesumar.edu.br). My role focused on automating internal audit processes and enhancing data-driven decision-making through system integrations and data analysis. I held this position until September 2020.

Following my time at UniCesumar, I joined [Cortex Intelligence](https://cortex-intelligence.com) as a Data Engineer. In this role, I had the opportunity to work with some of Brazil’s most valuable companies, utilizing cutting-edge technology for complex data integrations.

During 2021-2022, I contributed to the growth of [Stone Payments](http://stone.co/) as part of the infrastructure team. I focused on developing automations that streamlined processes for both my team and the wider company.

After my initial time at Stone, I joined [Toku](https://trytoku.com), where I helped automate recurring payments across Latin America, primarily by developing an internal platform.

I later returned to Stone Payments with a renewed focus on transforming the developer experience. I helped the construction of a new internal developer platform and lead a complete restructuring of the company's GitHub organization.

Having completed this mission, I left Stone at the end of 2025 to embrace a new challenge. I am now proud to be part of the team at **Thoughtworks**, where I am focused on exploring new markets and helping clients achieve success through excellence and innovation in infrastructure.
